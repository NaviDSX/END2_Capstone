Work In Progress..

Not an excuse:
- I have had issues with following up and completing tasks on time (for which I own the responsiblity), but following can be the reasons why the so called inefficient leads concept might fail, I am not sure if I am the only person who has this problem.
- I know the concept was done keeping the larger picture in mind and a shared learning approach but I do not subscribe to a haphazard, undocumented approach of creating a group with a lead where a basic trait of disseminating information to all members is not followed. There can be enough reasons for someone not to participate every week and its better to have a transparent centrally documented approach by you rather than relying on inefficient leads.
- I have not been included in the Pytorch Documentation Team Tasks nor did anyone including the so called lead reach out to me. The first week everyone in the group was sleeping, with no lead providing an update. I slept the next two weeks and I did not notice a public comment on the Telegram Group to join the Pytorch Documentation Group and the mentioned group just had one person in it and hence I did not join it without having enough clarity. You say Telegram Group is an preferred way of communication - it has completely failed in this case. A better close looped concept is needed in case you expect group tasks to be perfomed with appropriate fallback mechanisms and ETA for response.
- I reached out to your designated lead on 21st as a last effort (multiple times) to get tasks assigned and there has been no response.
- I will try to scrape the 1000 QnAs by myself from the Pytorch website and also convert it into XZY format, this might result in duplicates but I cannot find a better alternative.
- I will try to finish up the tasks at the earliest, max by the 20th day deadline.
